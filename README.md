MBTA Bus Tracker

A work in progress. All client-side JS. Open index.html in the browser to run.

Regardless of your selection for Direction, you will either get a full list of Inbound stops or a full list of Outbound stops.

For the Red Line, Southbound/Northbound directions use the same terminus name for some reason. Seems to be an issue with how the /shapes API call works.
